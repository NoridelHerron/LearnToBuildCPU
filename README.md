## Welcome to the LearnToBuildCPU project!
The primary purpose of this project is to make learning computer architecture easier and more accessible for students, hobbyists, and aspiring engineers. I want this to be the kind of resource I wish I had when I first started.

This project is designed to be:
- As basic and readable as possible – so even beginners can follow along.
- Modular and well-documented – each component is explained, with clear roles and signal flows.
- Built in multiple HDLs – such as VHDL and Verilog/SystemVerilog, so learners can compare and learn from different styles and languages.
- Expandable for deeper learning – while the core is kept simple, there are opportunities to learn more advanced topics such as:
    - Writing wrappers
    - Using records/structs
    - Building simulation testbenches
    - Understanding control signals, hazard detection, and forwarding

I know how it feels to work in the dark, trying to build something you don’t fully understand. That’s why everything in this project is being documented carefully—so as you build, you also understand.

## 📋 What I’ll Provide
- A detailed list of input/output signals for each module to guide the refactor
- Clear credit for contributors in the repo, documentation, and any related blog posts

---

## 🙌 Collaboration and Support
- I’ll be available for questions anytime — during the project and beyond
- I’m also seeking someone with strong computer architecture fundamentals, especially pipeline or control logic expertise, for guidance and feedback to validate design decisions

---

## 🧪 Testbench Plans
Once I finish my current superscalar project, I will:
- Write a SystemVerilog/VHDL testbench with assertions to ensure all contributor-built modules are rock solid
- Inject bugs to demonstrate debugging techniques
- Add a TCL + waveform debugging guide
- Possibly publish a tutorial or blog post for learners to follow

## 💡 Personal Vision & Acknowledgement
I’m aware that this project currently has several flaws and areas that need improvement. As I continue refactoring and connecting the modules properly according to the RISC-V standard, my personal goal is to rebuild the design following more standard and widely accepted practices—not just based on observation or intuition.

This project is also a learning journey for me. I'm actively seeking feedback and input from more experienced developers to ensure that the architecture and implementation reflect best practices. By doing this, I hope to both deepen my own understanding and make the project more reliable, educational, and transparent for others who want to learn.

## 🔧 Note to all contributors:
I’m currently preparing a list of tasks that you’ll be able to choose from based on your interests and comfort level. Each contributor will have their own branch named after their first name, so everyone can work independently while keeping the workflow organized.

If you have your own ideas on how you’d like to contribute, feel free to share—I’m definitely open to suggestions!

Let’s learn and build together. 🚀
