# LearnToBuildCPU - Refactor Project
I’m refactoring my first RISC-V pipeline CPU project into a more modular, beginner-friendly version — and I’d love to team up with other students or early learners who want to build practical experience and strengthen their resumes through hands-on work.

---

## 🧠 The Goal
Transform this project into a clear, educational resource by:
- Flattening the I/O (no records) so new learners can easily follow the signal flow
- Making modules clean and modular for easier study, modification, and extension
- Documenting everything clearly for those just starting out

---

## 📋 What I’ll Provide
- A detailed list of input/output signals for each module to guide the refactor
- Clear credit for contributors in the repo, documentation, and any related blog posts

---

## 🙌 Collaboration and Support
- I’ll be available for questions anytime — during the project and beyond
- I’m also seeking someone with strong computer architecture fundamentals, especially pipeline or control logic expertise, for guidance and feedback to validate design decisions

---

## 🧪 Testbench Plans
Once I finish my current superscalar project, I will:
- Write a SystemVerilog testbench with assertions to ensure all contributor-built modules are rock solid
- Inject bugs to demonstrate debugging techniques
- Add a TCL + waveform debugging guide
- Possibly publish a tutorial or blog post for learners to follow

---

## ⚠️ Acknowledgement
I’m aware that my project currently has many flaws. While I’ll work to refactor the modules and connect the pieces properly based on the RISC-V standard, I’m also actively seeking knowledgeable reviewers to help ensure the design follows best practices and standards.

---

## 🔧 Note to all contributors:
I’m currently working on the task lists that you’ll be able to choose from based on your interests and comfort level. Each contributor will have their own branch with their first name on it, so everyone can work independently while keeping things organized.
